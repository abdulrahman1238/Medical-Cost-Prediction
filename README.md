# Medical-Cost-Prediction
This project aims to predict medical costs using various machine learning techniques. The dataset includes patient information such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately estimates the medical costs based on these features.

# Key Features:

**Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to clean and prepare the data.
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizations and analysis to understand the data.
**Feature Engineering:** Transformations and new feature creation.
**Model Development:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forests.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Techniques to optimize model performance.
**Model Interpretation:** Analysis of feature importance and model behavior.
**Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed Jupyter notebook documenting the process, findings, and conclusions.
**Usage:**
Clone the repository and follow the steps in the Jupyter notebook to replicate the analysis and predictions.
